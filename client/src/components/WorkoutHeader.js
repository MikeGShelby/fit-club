              Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and
              boost your endurance. Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to
              your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more
              efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have
              more energy to tackle daily chores.
