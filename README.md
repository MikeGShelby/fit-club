A Social Fitness Application to Connect Fitness Enthusiasts
Due to COVID-19, the fitness community had to adapt to new ways to work out at home. 
Now with the growing virtual options, trainers need a means to find people who need help with their fitness goals 
and allow users to find people in their area that are hosting activities or classes to stay active.
